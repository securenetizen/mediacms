## Cinemata: An Enhanced MediaCMS-based Video Platform for Asia-Pacific Social Issue Films

[Cinemata](https://cinemata.org) is an open-source project that builds upon MediaCMS, enhancing it with features specifically designed for showcasing social issue films from the Asia-Pacific region. Since its public release in 2021, Cinemata has developed numerous features that were previously exclusive to its platform and not available in the core MediaCMS. The project is managed by EngageMedia, an Asia-Pacific non-profit advocating for digital rights, open-technology and social issue films.

Our goal is to make these Cinemata-specific integrations and improvements to MediaCMS available to the public, enabling more organizations to maximize the potential of this powerful video content management system.

### Key features:
- [Core MediaCMS features](https://github.com/mediacms-io/mediacms)
- Cinemata-specific enhancements:
  - Custom CSS and UI components for a unique, tailored look distinct from baseline MediaCMS
  - Featured video and playlists on the front page
  - Customized playlists and embedding options on the front page
  - Integration of Open AI Foundation's Whisper ASR model for English translation
  - Ability to upload, edit, and download .SRT files for subtitles or captions

### History

Cinemata's content originates from EngageMedia's previous video platform, which operated from 2006 to 2020 using the Plumi video content management system. By migrating this valuable archive to an improved MediaCMS-based platform, we're ensuring the preservation and continued accessibility of essential narratives from the region. Since its launch, the current Cinemata site has added more than 2,000 videos contributed by its active users, further enriching its collection of social issue films. Cinemata is co-developed by Markos Gogoulos of MediaCMS.

“Cinemata” comes from the combination of “cine”, which means “motion picture”, and “mata”, which means “eye” in several regional languages:

- In Bahasa Malaysia, Bahasa Indonesia, and Filipino, the word for “eye” is “mata”
- In Tetum (East Timor), the word for “eye” is “matan”
- In Vietnamese, the word for “eye” is “mắt”
- In Thai and Lao, the word for “eye” is “ta”

“Cinemata” represents our focus on highlighting Asia-Pacific perspectives and connecting issues, films, and filmmakers in the region.

### Cinemata 2.0

With Cinemata 2.0, we're building a community of developers, designers, and contributors who share our vision of bringing critical but often overlooked stories to the forefront. Join us in creating an enhanced version of MediaCMS that connects filmmakers, advocacy groups, human rights defenders, educators, and audiences through collaborative initiatives such as film screenings, archiving, curation, outreach, and promotion.

Help us empower voices across the Asia-Pacific and foster meaningful discussions on pressing social issues. By contributing to this project, you'll be part of an effort to make these powerful tools available to a wider range of organizations, amplifying the impact of visual storytelling for social change.​​​​​​​​​​

## Installation
The instructions have been tested on Ubuntu 22.04. Make sure there is no other services running in the system, specifically no nginx/postgresql, as the installation script will install them and replace any configs.

As root, clone the repository on /home/mediacms.io and run install.sh:

```
# cd /home
# mkdir mediacms.io && cd mediacms.io
# git clone https://github.com/securenetizen/mediacms mediacms && cd mediacms
# chmod +x install.sh
# ./install.sh
```

This should take a few minutes with dependencies etc. Make sure you enter a valid domain when asked (eg staging.cinemata.org)
